<h3>CSC 4310/6310: Parallel and Distributed Computing</h3>
<strong><em>Fall Semester 2018 Syllabus</em></strong><br>
<strong>Sparks Hall 311 --- Tues/Thurs 5:30pm-7:15pm</strong><br>
</center></html>
</WRAP>

==== Prerequisites ====
  * C/C++
  * CSC 3320 System Level Programming
  * Familiarity with a Unix Environment
  * Discrete Math

==== Programming Languages ====
  * C/C++
  * Cuda-C
  * Python3.x (possibly)

==== Instructor ====
  * Michael McDermott
  * email: mmcdermott2[at]gsu.edu
  * office: 25 park place, suite 729
  * office hours: Tues/Thurs before and after class in the classroom or by appointment
     * I prefer to have one-on-one office hours by appointment that way we schedule something that works for everyone. It also allows us to block out enough time without having to worry about being interrupted.  
     * this is a also a shared lab space so its best to make an appointment out of consideration for the others in the lab and so I can book a small conference room.

==== Grader Assistant ====
  * Tarun Kumar Ravipati
  * email : travipati1[at]student.gsu.edu

==== Textbook ====
â€œIntroduction to Parallel Computing," (Second Edition) Ananth Grama, Anshul Gupta, George Karypis, and Vipin Kumar. Addison-Wesley, 2003. ISBN 0-201-64865-2. [[https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Parallel-Computing-Ananth-Grama/dp/0201648652|Amazon]]

Additional Material will be employed from Parallel Programming in C with MPI and OpenMP by Michael Quinn. p [[https://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Programming-C-MPI-OpenMP/dp/0072822562|Amazon]]


==== Course Content ====
This course is intended to cover various aspects of parallel and distributed processing and algorithm design, with an emphasis on hands-on programming.

* We were originally scheduled to present projects on this day but as the projects have been removed in favor of more programming practice distributed over the semester there is no longer anything scheduled for this day for this class. Please take this time complete the extra credit assignment or study for your other classes! 

==== Assignments and Late Policy ====
Computer Science is the study of algorithms, which are instructions, it is assumed that students can follow instructions since they are designing and implementing them for a computer. Please pay attention to the instructions on a given assignment with regards to the language being used. If you do not follow the instructions you will not receive credit for the assignment. 

All programming assignments **must** be commented and must have a header block in each code file that includes at a minimum your name, the assignment number and the date. This may not be included as a specific instruction in a given assignment as it is a general requirement for the entire semester. This is not just good practice, it is essential for us to know whose files we are grading in order to assign grades and without this you may not receive credit for work you have turned in.

All assignments will be turned in through iCollege. Emailed in assignments will not be accepted. 

Late policy: iCollege will handle identifying late assignments and the cutoff for when assignments can no longer be accepted. This makes it fair and unbiased for everyone regardless of where they are in the world. Exceptions can be made in certain situations (ie: funerals, trips, hospital stays, etc) just keep in mind that iCollege is always set to local Atlanta time.

A given assignment can be up to three days late past the due date before it will no longer be accepted. It will lose a percentage of the points you would have earned based on how late it is.
  * 1 day -10%
  * 2 days -20%
  * 3 days -30%

<WRAP center round box 60%>
Hypothetical 1: Assignment is two days late, but would have earned 100% if on time.
<html><center>Grade = 1 - (.20)(1) = 80%</center></html>

Hypothetical 2: Assignment is one day late, but would have earned 85% if on time.
<html><center>Grade = .85 - (.10)(.85) = 76.5%</center></html>
</WRAP>

Partial credit and extra credit will be awarded based on milestones being reached for certain assignments. Details will be laid out in the given assignments instructions. This is going to be a very hands on course with more emphasis placed on making, doing and understanding and less on memorizing as such grading will reflect this. You will have to decide for yourself if it is worth the drop in grade to turn things in late. You can always turn something in on time then resubmit however whatever the last submission time is according to iCollege is what will be used to determine any late penalty.

==== Grading ====
We will use the official letter grade system that GSU requires us to enter for you at the end of the semester.

==== Classroom Conduct ====
  * Please do not eat in class. Its very distracting to the rest of us who are also probably just as hungry. 
  * Please do not sleep in class. If you are that tired you need to go get some real sleep in a real bed.
  * Please do not make phone calls, text, etc in class. Sometimes it is unavoidable, just leave your phone on vibrate then politely take the call in the hallway. No harm, no foul.
  * It will be beneficial to have a laptop or similar computing device for parts of the course, please do not abuse this to play games, watch movies, post social media, etc as it will be a distraction for others in the class.

Basically, just be polite and respectful of your fellow students.
==== Cheating ====
Work submitted for grading must be student's own. iCollege employs some very sophisticated checks against online and other resources. Plagiarism may/will result in non-droppable grade 0 for all involved, and could also risk further action. Refer to the university academic honesty policy for a complete treatment on what could potentially happen: [[https://deanofstudents.gsu.edu/student-conductpolicy-on-academic-honesty/]] 


==== Disclaimer ====
This is only a general plan for the semester and is subject to change. Please attend class regularly in order to be aware of any changes that may occur.
